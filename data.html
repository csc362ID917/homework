However, it is important to note that interval scales do not have a "true zero". This makes more sense with an example. Year of birth is ordinal (1999 is before 1998) and measure the difference between datapoints (1999 is one year more than 1998). You cannot be born in year zero, where no years come before it. Technically, you could be born at the start of the world, but that would not be realistic.')
